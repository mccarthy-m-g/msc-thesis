Here we show that the individual fingerprint of a human functional connectome can be maximized from a reconstruction procedure based on group-wise decomposition in a finite number of brain connectivity modes. We use data from the Human Connectome Project to demonstrate that the optimal reconstruction of the individual FCs through connectivity eigenmodes maximizes subject identifiability across resting-state and all seven tasks evaluated. The identifiability of the optimally reconstructed individual connectivity profiles increases both at the global and edgewise level, also when the reconstruction is imposed on additional functional data of the subjects. Furthermore, reconstructed FC data provide more robust associations with task-behavioral measurements. Finally, we extend this approach to also map the most task-sensitive functional connections. Results show that is possible to maximize individual fingerprinting in the functional connectivity domain regardless of the task, a crucial next step in the area of brain connectivity towards individualized connectomics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Amico","given":"Enrico"},{"family":"Goñi","given":"Joaquín"}],"container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-018-25089-1","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,29]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"8254","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"The quest for identifiability in human functional connectomes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25089-1","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"armstrongetal_BrainprintAssessingUniqueness_2015","abstract":"The human brain continually generates electrical potentials representing neural communication. These potentials can be measured at the scalp, and constitute the electroencephalogram (EEG). When the EEG is time-locked to stimulation – such as the presentation of a word – and averaged over many such presentations, the Event-Related Potential (ERP) is obtained. The functional characteristics of components of the ERP are well understood, and some components represent processing that may differ uniquely from individual to individual—such as the N400 component, which represents access to the semantic network. We applied several pattern classifiers to ERPs representing the response of individuals to a stream of text designed to be idiosyncratically familiar to different individuals. Results indicate that there are robustly identifiable features of the ERP that enable labeling of ERPs as belonging to individuals with accuracy reliably above chance (in the range of 82–97%). Further, these features are stable over time, as indicated by continued accurate identification of individuals from ERPs after a lag of up to six months. Even better, the high degree of labeling accuracy achieved in all cases was achieved with the use of only 3 electrodes on the scalp—the minimal possible number that can acquire clean data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Armstrong","given":"Blair C."},{"family":"Ruiz-Blondet","given":"Maria V."},{"family":"Khalifian","given":"Negin"},{"family":"Kurtz","given":"Kenneth J."},{"family":"Jin","given":"Zhanpeng"},{"family":"Laszlo","given":"Sarah"}],"container-title":"Neurocomputing","container-title-short":"Neurocomputing","DOI":"10.1016/j.neucom.2015.04.025","ISSN":"0925-2312","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,10,20]]},"language":"en","page":"59-67","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Brainprint: Assessing the uniqueness, collectability, and permanence of a novel method for ERP biometrics","title-short":"Brainprint","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231215004725","volume":"166"},

Among the various modalities that have been developed, EEG-based biometrics features unparalleled universality, distinctiveness, and collectability, while minimizing the risk of circumvention. However, commercializing EEG-based person recognition poses a number of challenges. This paper reviews the various systems proposed over the past few years with a focus on the shortcomings that have prevented wide-scale implementation, including issues pertaining to temporal stability, psychological and physiological changes, protocol design, equipment, and performance evaluation. We also examine several directions for the further development of usable EEG-based recognition systems as well as the niche markets to which they could be applied.

The practical implications of individual variability are of basic relevance for both group level and subject level studies. The Electroencephalogram (EEG), still represents one of the most used recording techniques to investigate a wide range of brain-related features. In this work, we aim to estimate the effect of individual variability on a set of very simple and easily interpretable features extracted from the EEG power spectra. In particular, in an identification scenario, we investigated how the aperiodic (1/f background) component of the EEG power spectra can accurately identify subjects from a large EEG dataset. The results of this study show that the aperiodic component of the EEG signal is characterized by strong subject-specific properties, that this feature is consistent across different experimental conditions (eyes-open and eyes-closed) and outperforms the canonically-defined frequency bands. These findings suggest that the simple features (slope and offset) extracted from the aperiodic component of the EEG signal are sensitive to individual traits and may help to characterize and make inferences at single subject-level.","author":[{"family":"Demuru","given":"Matteo"},{"family":"Fraschini","given":"Matteo"}],"container-title":"Computers in Biology and Medicine","container-title-short":"Comput.

  {"id":"finnetal_CanBrainState_2017","abstract":"While neuroimaging studies typically collapse data from many subjects, brain functional organization varies between individuals, and characterizing this variability is crucial for relating brain activity to behavioral phenotypes. Rest has become the default state for probing individual differences, chiefly because it is easy to acquire and a supposed neutral backdrop. However, the assumption that rest is the optimal condition for individual differences research is largely untested. In fact, other brain states may afford a better ratio of within- to between-subject variability, facilitating biomarker discovery. Depending on the trait or behavior under study, certain tasks may bring out meaningful idiosyncrasies across subjects, essentially enhancing the individual signal in networks of interest beyond what can be measured at rest. Here, we review theoretical considerations and existing work on how brain state influences individual differences in functional connectivity, present some preliminary analyses of within- and between-subject variability across conditions using data from the Human Connectome Project, and outline questions for future study.","author":[{"family":"Finn","given":"Emily S."},{"family":"Scheinost","given":"Dustin"},{"family":"Finn","given":"Daniel M."},{"family":"Shen","given":"Xilin"},{"family":"Papademetris","given":"Xenophon"},{"family":"Constable","given":"R.

Characteristic connectivity patterns were distributed throughout the brain, but the frontoparietal network emerged as most distinctive.

In this context, the present paper aims to investigate the impact of some of the most commonly used metrics to estimate functional connectivity on the ability to unveil personal distinctive patterns of inter-channel interactions. Different metrics were compared in terms of equal error rate. It is widely accepted that each connectivity metric carries specific information in respect to the underlying interactions. Experimental results on publicly available EEG recordings show that different connectivity metrics define peculiar subjective profile of connectivity and show different mechanisms to detect subject-specific patterns of inter-channel interactions. Moreover, these findings highlight that some measures are more accurate and more robust than others, regardless of the task performed by the user.

  {"id":"kongetal_EEGFingerprintsPhase_2019","abstract":"The goal of biometrics is to recognize humans based on their physical and behavioral characteristics. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that the electroencephalogram(EEG) is potentially more secure and private than traditional biometric identifiers. At present, the EEG identification method targets specific tasks and cannot be generalized. In this study, a novel EEG-based biometric identification method that extracts the phase synchronization (PS) features for subject identification is proposed under a variety of tasks. We quantified the PS features by the phase locking value (PLV) in different frequency bands. Subsequently, we employed the principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension. Then, we used the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to construct a projection space and projected the features onto the projection space. Finally, a feature vector was assigned to the class label. The experimental results of the proposed method used on 3 datasets with different cognitive tasks showed high classification accuracies and relatively good stabilities. From the results, we found that particularly in the beta and gamma bands, the average accuracies are more than 97% with the standard deviation equal to or less than the magnitude 10e-2 for both Dataset 1 and Dataset 2. For Dataset 3, the PS feature vectors in all off the bands have high classification accuracies, which are more than 97% with the standard deviation of the same magnitude.

Most of the current analyses rely on the extraction of features characterizing the activity of single brain regions, like power spectrum estimation, thus neglecting possible temporal dependencies between the generated EEG signals. However, important physiological information can be extracted from the way different brain regions are functionally coupled. In this study, we propose a novel approach that fuses spectral coherence-based connectivity between different brain regions as a possibly viable biometric feature. The proposed approach is tested on a large dataset of subjects (N = 108) during eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) resting state conditions. The obtained recognition performance shows that using brain connectivity leads to higher distinctiveness with respect to power-spectrum measurements, in both the experimental conditions. Notably, a 100% recognition accuracy is obtained in EC and EO when integrating functional connectivity between regions in the frontal lobe, while a lower 97.5% is obtained in EC (96.26% in EO) when fusing power spectrum information from parieto-occipital (centro-parietal in EO) regions.

In the first step, we tested the long-term reliability of functional connectomes derived from amplitude-based functional connectivity (the conventional method) and found that they remained accurate markers (>85%, p < 0.001, permutation test) for identifying individuals, even after a period longer than 800 days. Using the same data set, we further expanded our exploration of the extent to which two analytic components of oscillatory activity (amplitude envelope and instantaneous phase) may function as reliable fingerprints. Both analytic signals-in particular, the instantaneous phase-were identified as useful indices in shaping functional connectivity fingerprints (86%, p < 0.001, permutation test). Connectivity profiles derived from the ventral attention, frontoparietal, and default mode networks were the largest contributing factors to identification. The current results suggest that neural synchronization tapped by analytical signal from a low-frequency resting-state fMRI blood oxygen level-dependent oscillation could be a reliable and useful fingerprint for identifying individuals and might provide an alternative method for characterizing dynamic functional connectivity profiles.","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Ruibin"},{"family":"Kranz","given":"Georg S."},{"family":"Lee","given":"Tatia M.
