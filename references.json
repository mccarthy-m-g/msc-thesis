  {"id":"chanetal_ChallengesFuturePerspectives_2018","abstract":"The emergence of the digital world has greatly increased the number of accounts and passwords that users must remember. It has also increased the need for secure access to personal information in the cloud. Biometrics is one approach to person recognition, which can be used in identification as well as authentication. Among the various modalities that have been developed, EEG-based biometrics features unparalleled universality, distinctiveness, and collectability, while minimizing the risk of circumvention. However, commercializing EEG-based person recognition poses a number of challenges. This paper reviews the various systems proposed over the past few years with a focus on the shortcomings that have prevented wide-scale implementation, including issues pertaining to temporal stability, psychological and physiological changes, protocol design, equipment, and performance evaluation. We also examine several directions for the further development of usable EEG-based recognition systems as well as the niche markets to which they could be applied. It is expected that rapid advancements in EEG instrumentation, on-device processing, and machine learning techniques will lead to the emergence of commercialized person recognition systems in the near future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Chan","given":"Hui-Ling"},{"family":"Kuo","given":"Po-Chih"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Chia-Yi"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yong-Sheng"}],"container-title":"Frontiers in Neuroinformatics","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"demurufraschini_EEGFingerprintingSubjectspecific_2020","abstract":"During the last few years, there has been growing interest in the effects induced by individual variability on activation patterns and brain connectivity. The practical implications of individual variability are of basic relevance for both group level and subject level studies. The Electroencephalogram (EEG), still represents one of the most used recording techniques to investigate a wide range of brain-related features. In this work, we aim to estimate the effect of individual variability on a set of very simple and easily interpretable features extracted from the EEG power spectra. In particular, in an identification scenario, we investigated how the aperiodic (1/f background) component of the EEG power spectra can accurately identify subjects from a large EEG dataset. The results of this study show that the aperiodic component of the EEG signal is characterized by strong subject-specific properties, that this feature is consistent across different experimental conditions (eyes-open and eyes-closed) and outperforms the canonically-defined frequency bands. These findings suggest that the simple features (slope and offset) extracted from the aperiodic component of the EEG signal are sensitive to individual traits and may help to characterize and make inferences at single subject-level.","author":[{"family":"Demuru","given":"Matteo"},{"family":"Fraschini","given":"Matteo"}],"container-title":"Computers in Biology and Medicine","container-title-short":"Comput.

  {"id":"finnetal_FunctionalConnectomeFingerprinting_2015","abstract":"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies typically collapse data from many subjects, but brain functional organization varies between individuals. Here we establish that this individual variability is both robust and reliable, using data from the Human Connectome Project to demonstrate that functional connectivity profiles act as a 'fingerprint' that can accurately identify subjects from a large group. Identification was successful across scan sessions and even between task and rest conditions, indicating that an individual's connectivity profile is intrinsic, and can be used to distinguish that individual regardless of how the brain is engaged during imaging. Characteristic connectivity patterns were distributed throughout the brain, but the frontoparietal network emerged as most distinctive. Furthermore, we show that connectivity profiles predict levels of fluid intelligence: the same networks that were most discriminating of individuals were also most predictive of cognitive behavior. Results indicate the potential to draw inferences about single subjects on the basis of functional connectivity fMRI.","author":[{"family":"Finn","given":"Emily S."},{"family":"Shen","given":"Xilin"},{"family":"Scheinost","given":"Dustin"},{"family":"Rosenberg","given":"Monica D."},{"family":"Huang","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Chun","given":"Marvin M."},{"family":"Papademetris","given":"Xenophon"},{"family":"Constable","given":"R.

  {"id":"fraschinietal_RobustnessFunctionalConnectivity_2019","abstract":"Growing interest is devoted to understanding in which situations and with what accuracy brain signals recorded from scalp electroencephalography (EEG) may represent unique fingerprints of individual neural activity. In this context, the present paper aims to investigate the impact of some of the most commonly used metrics to estimate functional connectivity on the ability to unveil personal distinctive patterns of inter-channel interactions. Different metrics were compared in terms of equal error rate. It is widely accepted that each connectivity metric carries specific information in respect to the underlying interactions. Experimental results on publicly available EEG recordings show that different connectivity metrics define peculiar subjective profile of connectivity and show different mechanisms to detect subject-specific patterns of inter-channel interactions. Moreover, these findings highlight that some measures are more accurate and more robust than others, regardless of the task performed by the user. Finally, it is important to consider that frequency content and spurious connectivity may still play a relevant role in determining subject-specific characteristics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Fraschini","given":"Matteo"},{"family":"Pani","given":"Sara Maria"},{"family":"Didaci","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Marcialis","given":"Gian Luca"}],"container-title":"Pattern Recognition Letters","container-title-short":"Pattern Recognition Letters","DOI":"10.1016/j.patrec.2019.03.025","ISSN":"0167-8655","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"49-54","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Robustness of functional connectivity metrics for EEG-based personal identification over task-induced intra-class and inter-class variations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865519301084","volume":"125"},
  {"id":"kongetal_EEGFingerprintsPhase_2019","abstract":"The goal of biometrics is to recognize humans based on their physical and behavioral characteristics. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that the electroencephalogram(EEG) is potentially more secure and private than traditional biometric identifiers. At present, the EEG identification method targets specific tasks and cannot be generalized. In this study, a novel EEG-based biometric identification method that extracts the phase synchronization (PS) features for subject identification is proposed under a variety of tasks. We quantified the PS features by the phase locking value (PLV) in different frequency bands. Subsequently, we employed the principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension. Then, we used the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to construct a projection space and projected the features onto the projection space. Finally, a feature vector was assigned to the class label. The experimental results of the proposed method used on 3 datasets with different cognitive tasks showed high classification accuracies and relatively good stabilities. From the results, we found that particularly in the beta and gamma bands, the average accuracies are more than 97% with the standard deviation equal to or less than the magnitude 10e-2 for both Dataset 1 and Dataset 2. For Dataset 3, the PS feature vectors in all off the bands have high classification accuracies, which are more than 97% with the standard deviation of the same magnitude. Our work demonstrated that the phase synchronization of EEG signals has task-free biometric properties, which can be used for subject identification.","author":[{"family":"Kong","given":"Wanzeng"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Luyun"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Sijia"},{"family":"Babiloni","given":"Fabio"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Hang"}],"container-title":"IEEE Access","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931624","ISSN":"2169-3536","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"page":"121165-121173","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"EEG Fingerprints: Phase Synchronization of EEG Signals as Biomarker for Subject Identification","title-short":"EEG Fingerprints","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

Specifically the resting state with closed eyes acquisition protocol has been here used and deeply investigated by varying the employed electrodes configuration both in number and location for optimizing the recognition performance still guaranteeing sufficient user convenience. A database of 45 healthy subjects has been employed in the analysis. Autoregressive stochastic modeling and polynomial regression based classification has been applied to extracted brain rhythms in order to identify the most distinctive contributions of the different subbands in the recognition process. Our analysis has shown that significantly high recognition rates, up to 98.73%, can be achieved when using proper triplets of electrodes,which cannot be achieved by employing couple of electrodes,whereas sets of five electrodes in the central posterior region of the scalp can guarantee very high recognition performance while limiting user convenience.","author":[{"family":"La Rocca","given":"Daria"},{"family":"Campisi","given":"Patrizio"},{"family":"Scarano","given":"Gaetano"}],"container-title":"2012 BIOSIG - Proceedings of the International Conference of Biometrics Special Interest Group (BIOSIG)","event":"2012 BIOSIG - Proceedings of the International Conference of Biometrics Special Interest Group (BIOSIG)","ISSN":"1617-5468","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,9]]},"page":"1-12","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"EEG biometrics for individual recognition in resting state with closed eyes","type":"paper-conference"}
