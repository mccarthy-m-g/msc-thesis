## Research Question

**Broadly:** How do individual differences in EEG activity relate to individual differences in behaviour and cognition?

**Specifically:** Can we (1) identify and differentiate between individuals in a data set purely from their EEG activity? (2) predict individual differences in performance on a task purely from individual differences in EEG activity from before, during, or after the task? (3) is identification and prediction stable across different sessions?

**Additionally:** Can we use EEG signal variability or complexity as a marker for fingerprinting?

## Research Need

Why is this research needed? How is this research unique?

>"There are two main reasons to study individual differences in the course of neuroimaging research. First, of basic scientific concern, more precise descriptions of brain activity in single subjects moves us closer to a mechanistic understanding of how neural events give rise to cognition and action. Second, of practical concern, mapping from individual brains to individual behaviors is a crucial step in developing imaging-based biomarkers with real-world utility." [@finnetal_CanBrainState_2017]

"Mapping from individual brains to individual behaviors is a crucial step in developing imaging-based biomarkers with real-world utility" seems like a nice way to phrase the real-world importance of my project, since I'll be working with healthy subjects, but ultimately this work can be a stepping stone to help clinical populations.

>"The persistence of individual characteristics in EEG data has yet to be investigated" [@chanetal_ChallengesFuturePerspectives_2018].

>Call to use complexity or connectivity for EEG fingerprinting by @chanetal_ChallengesFuturePerspectives_2018: "Neural complexity can be regarded as irregularity of activity in the brain, which is related to brain functions and information processing (McDonough and Nashiro, 2014). Therefore, differences in the complexity of data embedded in EEG can be used to differentiate among entities. Entropy is one measure by which to assess the complexity of the brain, and it has also been used in person authentication (Mu et al., 2016). Calculating entropy at various temporal scales makes it possible to formulate a complete description of the non-linearity in EEG signals (Gao et al., 2015). We suggest using both linear and non-linear features of EEG signals with different temporal scales as a means of increasing accuracy. ... The second approach is the use of connectivity in the human brain, including functional and effective connectivity (Friston, 2011), to assess the interactions between various regions of the brain."

>"Much previous work has been concerned with separating the functional connectivity signal into state versus trait components: for example, by investigating the test-retest reliability of resting-state connectivity within individuals (depending on the choices of connectivity analysis and reliability metric, it’s generally low to moderate (Birn et al., 2013; Braun et al., 2012; Shehzad et al., 2009; Zuo and Xing, 2014), or comparing group-averaged network organization across brain states (it’s grossly similar between rest and any of several tasks (Cole 10 et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2009)). *However, there is little work at the intersection of these lines of research, investigating how brain state affects test-retest reliability of single subjects, or measurements of individual differences across subjects.*" [@finnetal_CanBrainState_2017]

>"The end goal of most neuroimaging research into individual differences is to relate brain measures to behavior. Ultimately, we should be striving to not simply report correlations between connectivity patterns and phenotypes, but to build predictive models that can take in neuroimaging information from a previously unseen subject and predict something about their present or future behavior, such as cognitive ability, risk for illness, or response to treatment, to name a few (Bach et al., 2013; Gabrieli et al., 2015; Lo et al., 2015; Whelan and Garavan, 2014). With this in mind, *the question is not which states maximize the ratio of within- to between-subject variability in and of itself, but rather which states maximize this ratio while drawing out variation that is relevant to a phenotype of interest*. To this end, investigators might try varying the input to connectivity-based predictive models (Shen et al., in press) by testing several states and determining which yields the best behavioral prediction, using data sets such as HCP and others that contain multiple scan conditions and behavioral measures for each subject." [@finnetal_CanBrainState_2017]

> "There is growing recognition in human neuroscience that mean-based approaches, in which data are averaged across many individuals, may obscure more than they reveal about brain-behavior relationships (Speelman and McGann, 2013). In fact, the perceived “universality” of functional brain regions and networks may be more an epiphenomenon of how we analyze our data than a reflection of how individual brains actually work. ... It is worth exploring alternative paradigms for individual differences research, as other brain states may afford an improved ratio of within- to between-subject variability, and/or enhance the individual connectivity signature in networks of interest. A better understanding of how brain state affects measurements of individual differences is important from a cognitive neuroscience perspective, and may increase our chances of finding imaging-based biomarkers with translational utility."

## Fingerprinting Methodology

Identification experiments often require that a given connectivity profile acquired in one session
is matched to the same individual’s profile (i.e., you need an index to compare individuals to).

>"EEG-based biometrics are applicable to person recognition applications, including identification and authentication systems. Personal identification systems predict the identity of a user from among all enrolled clients, whereas authentication systems validate the identity claimed by a user. Despite differing purposes, both systems make decisions based on the EEG features of the user and all clients in the database and therefore share the following four components: a database, an EEG acquisition system, a signal preprocessing system, and a feature extraction system. ... The performance of EEG-based person recognition systems relies on the design of signal acquisition protocols, feature extraction methods, and classification techniques." [@chanetal_ChallengesFuturePerspectives_2018].

>"Databases impose four basic challenges: (1) number of users: as the number of subjects increases, it becomes increasingly difficult for the system to accurately classify users. Previous studies have used between 3 and 120 participants. ... (3) Variations at the individual level: most previous studies collected data from individual subjects once only. However, as mentioned previously, the brain changes over time and one’s mental state can have a tremendous influence on brain activity." [@chanetal_ChallengesFuturePerspectives_2018].

>"Generally, protocols involving tasks are more reproducible than those without tasks, such as resting-state brain signals. Furthermore, protocols that involve simple tasks based on sensory inputs are more reproducible than those with complex tasks requiring cognitive processing. However, there is a tradeoff between reproducibility and distinctiveness. Protocols capable of evoking brain activity patterns with personal characteristics are regarded as particularly suitable. Brain activity patterns generated during cognitive tasks are distinctive between individuals, which makes them useful in biometric systems; however, these tasks also tend to be time-consuming." [@chanetal_ChallengesFuturePerspectives_2018].

>In evaluating fingerprinting accuracy it is important that: "(1) Testing data should be independent or nearly independent from the training data. ... (2) Additional indices of performance should be reported. ... (3) Researchers report the duration of the EEG data used or the information transfer rate (ITR). ... (4) In studies with a small sample size, the accuracy of results should be tested using statistical methods that take the size of the sample as well as variations between subjects into account." [@chanetal_ChallengesFuturePerspectives_2018].

>"The problem of template aging can be overcome by ensuring the completeness of the representation for each enrolled client prior to the training of classifiers. This means that for each individual, EEG data obtained under various conditions and at different times should be included in the training data sets. ... e.g., In recent developments of biometrics in smartphone authentication, the models used for face or fingerprint recognition are adjusted during every login procedure. ... We therefore strongly recommend the use of longitudinal EEG acquisition and performance evaluation during training steps in order to improve the temporal persistence of EEG-based biometric systems." [@chanetal_ChallengesFuturePerspectives_2018].

>"EEG measurements can be affected by psychological and physiological factors. ... Thus, developing a stable and effective EEG-based biometric system requires an understanding of the factors affecting EEG, as well as a means of selecting EEG features with high stability and distinctiveness. ... This model also makes it possible to predict changes in features, thereby enabling the biometric system to maintain high recognition accuracy over time. ... The accumulation of abundant knowledge concerning the influence of various factors makes it possible for researchers to build a model capable of making accurate predictions of EEG features under varying conditions. The use of a prediction model in conjunction with feature augmentation could greatly reduce the time required to obtain training data." [@chanetal_ChallengesFuturePerspectives_2018].

>"Hypothetically, what would be the ideal condition for measuring individual differences?
Simply maximizing between-subject variability—i.e., making subjects look as different as
possible from one another—is not necessarily the answer. Rather, the optimal condition should
make subjects look as different as possible while also retaining the most important features of
each individual. ... There are two ways to boost identifiability (a metric that is, in this case, subjective, but is a proxy for trait-level variance associated with some phenotype of interest): by exaggerating the most prominent features of each individual (the “caricature” condition), which incidentally makes subjects look more different from one another, or by blurring irrelevant features while retaining and enriching relevant ones (“selective enhancement”)." [@finnetal_CanBrainState_2017]

>"Certain in-scanner tasks could act as neuropsychiatric “stress tests” to enhance individual differences in the general population, or, in at-risk individuals, to reveal abnormal patterns of brain activity before they show up at rest. While a variety of tasks might serve this role, naturalistic paradigms—e.g., having subjects watch a movie or listen to a story in the scanner—are especially intriguing candidates. By imposing a standardized yet engaging stimulus on all subjects, naturalistic tasks evoke rich patterns of brain activity. These patterns lend themselves to functional connectivity analysis as well as other data-driven techniques such as inter-subject correlation (ISC) (Hasson et al., 2004) and inter-subject functional connectivity (ISFC) (Simony et al., 2016), which are model-free ways to isolate stimulus-dependent brain activity from spontaneous activity and noise. ... While naturalistic tasks are promising, any task that elicits variable brain activity and/or behavior across subjects is a worthwhile candidate." [@finnetal_CanBrainState_2017]

>"Much of the variance in functional connectivity is intrinsic to an individual, and not associated with how the brain is engaged during scanning. Similar results have now been reported using other data sets (Airan et al., 2016). ... However, our exploratory analysis showed that between-subject variability does, in fact, change with brain state. Overall, individuals tended to look more similar during tasks than during rest. Additionally, in nearly all conditions, females were more similar to other females than males were to other males. ... males. *These results suggest that investigators should take into account sex when choosing conditions to maximize individual variability:* tasks that maximize variability in females may not do the same for males, and vice versa. This may be especially important when studying traits relevant to neuropsychiatric illnesses that disproportionately affect one sex or the other." [@finnetal_CanBrainState_2017]

>"Individual differences do, in fact, change depending on the condition in which they are measured. ... Interestingly, conditions that make subjects look more similar to one another also make better databases in identification experiments. ... The high correlation between database score and between-subject similarity suggests that *task conditions mainly serve to reduce intra-individual variability, while preserving meaningful inter-individual variance* (i.e., variance related to true individual differences)." [@finnetal_CanBrainState_2017]

>"Of note, linking imaging measures to behavior crucially depends on choosing the right behavior." [@finnetal_CanBrainState_2017]

What will the study look like?

How is the study unique?

get a one paragraph description of what my thesis is about. then send that to andrea. focus on big picture and differentiate it from the existing literature—if people have done a lot of work linking fingerprinting to cognition then we have to work around how the project is unique; if there isn’t much work linking it to cognition then we have more room to stake out room for the study. And LDT is a good task to link to performance since it’s well understood. Sending a draft that doesn’t have to be perfect.

tie brain variability/complexity into fingerprinting; ask Amir about his recently published graph theory paper

look at EEG fingerprinting papers and identify the best methods

How does the brain switch from task to resting, and the switch between the two. and we can justify this with Finn’s manipulating brain state paper
